# Restuarant-POS-Front-End

## Objective

Brain storm ideas of how an ideal (generic) restuarant POS Front End should look like.

Conduct research using various data collection techniques to determine what core factors are relevant when considering the Front End part of a POS system. 

Using findings from the research to develop a Front-End prototype of a restuarant POS system.

Design of the prototype was heavily dependant on factors provided by participants who were currently employed at various restuarants.

Do user test studies to gather feedback on the functionality, usefulness and efficiancy of the high fidelity prototype.

The main goal of the project was to do field research to enable us to design, build and test the Front-End part of a POS system that would improve productivity and reduce stress for restuarant employees.
