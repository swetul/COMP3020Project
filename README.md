# Restuarant-POS-Front-End

# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Project

## Objective
Conduct research to collect data using various data collection techniques that can provide some insight on what visual and functional factors are neccessary and useful for making a web-based POS system for any type of restuarant.

Using findings from the research to develop a Front-End version of a restuarant POS system.

Design of the prototype was heavily dependant on factors provided by participants who were currently employed at various restuarants.

The main goal of the project was to do field research to enable us to design, build and test the Front-End part of a POS system that would improve productivity and reduce stress for restuarant employees.
