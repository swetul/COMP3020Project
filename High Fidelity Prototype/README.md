# High-Fidelity Prototype

## Objective
Using findings from the research to develop a Front-End prototype of a restuarant POS system.

Design of the prototype was heavily dependant on factors provided by participants who were currently employed at various restuarants.

The main goal of the project was to do field research to enable us to design, build and test the Front-End part of a POS system that would improve productivity and reduce stress for restuarant employees.
